# Predicting-continuous-variables-with-Images
'Have you ever build a model that predicts continuous values with images as input? This article just gives a brief about how to train your model with X as images and Y as continuous numbers'

There are very few cases where you would want to predict a value in a continuous range of numbers based on an Image. Most of the Image Deepnet problems tend to be built for classifying the Images but there also stands a case for Regression based on Images. This article just gives a basic idea for beginners on how to train a model with Images and continuous variables as the target.
